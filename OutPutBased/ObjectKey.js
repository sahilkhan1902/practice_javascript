let x = { b: 1, c: 2 }; 
let y = Object.keys(x); 
console.log(y.length); 

/*
Explanation: The code first creates an object x with two properties b and c, and assigns it to the variable x. Then, the Object.keys() method is used to retrieve an array of the keys of x, which are “b” and “c”. This array is assigned to the variable y.

Finally, the length of the array y (which is the number of keys in x) is printed to the console using console.log(). Since y has two elements, the output of y.length will be 2.*/
